        question: "How long does WhatsApp account recovery take?",
        answer: "Most WhatsApp account recoveries are completed within 24-48 hours. However, complex cases or permanent bans may take up to 3-5 business days. Our professional service has a 98% success rate with faster turnaround times."
      },
      {
        id: 2,
        question: "What information do I need to provide for account recovery?",
        answer: "You'll need to provide your phone number (with country code), the date when your account was banned, the reason for the ban (if known), and any error messages you received. Additional information like previous violations or business verification may be helpful."
      },
      {
        id: 3,
        question: "Can permanently banned WhatsApp accounts be recovered?",
        answer: "Yes, even permanently banned accounts can often be recovered with the right approach. Our professional team has specialized methods and direct contacts with WhatsApp that significantly increase the chances of successful recovery, even for permanent bans."
      },
      {
        id: 4,
        question: "Is the WhatsApp unban service safe and legitimate?",
        answer: "Absolutely. We use only legitimate methods that comply with WhatsApp's policies. Our process involves proper appeals through official channels and doesn't involve any hacking or illegal activities. Your account security and privacy are our top priorities."
      },
      {
        id: 5,
        question: "What happens to my chat history and contacts after recovery?",
        answer: "In most cases, your chat history, contacts, and media are preserved during the recovery process. However, we recommend backing up your data regularly. If you have a recent backup, you can restore it once your account is recovered."
      },
      {
        id: 6,
        question: "Do you offer a money-back guarantee?",
        answer: "Yes, we offer a 100% money-back guarantee. If we cannot successfully recover your WhatsApp account within the promised timeframe, you will receive a full refund. We stand behind our service quality and success rate."
      },
      {
        id: 7,
        question: "Why was my WhatsApp account banned?",
        answer: "Common reasons include sending spam messages, using unofficial WhatsApp versions, violating community guidelines, receiving multiple user reports, or using automation tools. Our team can help identify the specific reason and create a recovery strategy."
      },
      {
        id: 8,
        question: "Can I prevent my account from being banned again?",
        answer: "Yes! After recovery, we provide guidelines on best practices: use only official WhatsApp apps, avoid bulk messaging, respect community guidelines, don't use third-party tools, and maintain appropriate messaging frequency."
      },
      {
        id: 9,
        question: "What's the difference between temporary and permanent bans?",
        answer: "Temporary bans usually last 24-48 hours and lift automatically. Permanent bans require professional intervention. We can recover both types, but permanent bans need specialized appeal processes and take longer to resolve."
      },
      {
        id: 10,
        question: "How much does the recovery service cost?",
        answer: "Our WhatsApp account recovery service costs â‚¹5,000 (Indian Rupees). This includes complete case analysis, professional appeal submission, and follow-up until your account is restored. Payment is only required after successful recovery."
